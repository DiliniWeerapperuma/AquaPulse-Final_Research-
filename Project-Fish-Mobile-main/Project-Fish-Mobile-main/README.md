## 01. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed on your computer.

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) latest
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) with Dart and Flutter extensions
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with the Flutter plugin


## 02. Setting Up Development Environment

**Preparing for Android Studio and Emulator Installation:**

Ensure Adequate Hard Disk Space: Before starting, ensure that you have at least 20GB of free hard disk space. This space is necessary for the Android Studio installation, SDKs, emulators, and system images.

Check System Requirements: Ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements to run Android Studio efficiently. As of my last update, these requirements include:

- **OS:** Windows (10 or later), macOS (10.14 or later), GNOME or KDE desktop on Linux
- **RAM:** Minimum 4 GB RAM, 8 GB RAM recommended
- **Disk Space:** Minimum 2 GB of available disk space, 4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image)
- **Screen Resolution:** 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution

**Overall, you need 20GB on your C: drive to run Flutter and all plugins with C: drive free space for smooth running.**

For the latest requirements, check the [official Android Studio download page.](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-install-android-studio#0)

## 03. **Enable developer mode only Windows:**

Here’s how to execute the command:

    ms-settings:developers

---

Press the Windows key on your keyboard.

2. Type “Command Prompt” or “cmd” in the search bar.

3. Right-click on “Command Prompt” in the search results.

4. Select “Run as administrator” to open an elevated command prompt.

5. Copy the command mentioned above and paste it into the command prompt window.

6. Press Enter to execute the command.

This will open the “Developer options” settings page in the Windows Settings app, where you can enable or disable Developer Mode and access other developer-related settings.

## 04. **Download Java/JDK:**

Visit the Oracle JDK download page and download newest version: (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/).

1. Accept the license agreement.
2. Download the JDK appropriate for your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
3. Run the downloaded JDK installer.
4. Follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.
5. Choose the installation directory for the JDK.
6. Complete the installation process.
7. Open the Start menu and search for “Environment Variables.”
8. Click on “Edit the system environment variables.”
9. Click the “Environment Variables” button at the bottom.
10. Under the “System Variables” section, click “New” to add a new variable.
11. Set the variable name as JAVA_HOME.
12. Set the variable value as the path to your JDK installation directory with your version path (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\).
13. Click “OK” to save the changes.

## 05. **Verify JDK Installation**

1. Open a command prompt or PowerShell.
2. Type java — version and press Enter.

Command:

    java — version

---

3. Verify that the installed JDK version is displayed without any errors.

After completing these steps, you have successfully downloaded and installed the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system. Android Studio should now be able to locate and utilize the JDK for Flutter app development.

## 06. **Installing Android Studio(for Android development) and Setting Up a New Emulator:**

Install Android Studio: If you haven't already installed Android Studio, download it from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

1. Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

12. Adjust settings as needed.
13. Click "Finish".

Launch the New Emulator: In the AVD Manager, start your new 'Pixel 6a API 33' emulator.

## 07. **Setting Up Flutter in VSCode(recommended code editor) with Android Studio Emulator:**

1. **Install Flutter and Dart Plugins in VSCode:**

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and Open VSCode
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.

  2. You can use VSCode's debugging tools to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and more.
  3. Use the 'Hot Reload' feature by saving your files or using the appropriate command to see changes in real-time on the emulator.

## 08. **Set up Android licenses**

It’s important to note that accepting the licenses is a one-time process, usually performed during the initial setup or when adding new SDK components. It helps ensure compliance and grants you the legal permissions to utilize the Android SDK for development purposes.

Open a command prompt or PowerShell.
Run the following command to accept the Android licenses:

    flutter doctor — android-licenses
